# *YOOT* Game

## Game Description
*Yoot*, also known as *yunnori* or *yut*, is a traditional Korean game, often played around the Lunar New Year. It's one of my favorite game to play with friends! Each team or player rolls 4 sticks to determine how many spaces to move their *mal*, or game piece, on the board. First player or team to get all of their *mal* pieces past the last square wins! The history and the full rules of the game can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnori) or a video of gameplay can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v8AXG6_Gnk&amp;t=95s).
